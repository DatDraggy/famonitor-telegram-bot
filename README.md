# famonitor.com Telegram Bot

This isn't supposed to be used by anyone except me since only I have the database, 
but you're welcome to use this for inspiration. I will not give any support, though.

### Release

@famonitor_bot on Telegram is now basically finished. 
Maybe I will add some more things, maybe not. 

I'm happy that I got it working this fast.

### To-Do List

- [x] /add
- [X] /remove
- [x] /removall
- [x] /list
- [x] Monitoring
- [x] Notifying
- [x] /title
- [x] Use require_once like a decent human being instead of shell_exec, #title, #add, #remove, #list, #removeall
- [ ] By-text comm state monitor
